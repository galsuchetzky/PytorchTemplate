add visualization of examples and predictions (maybe using tensorboard)
add function to visualize random (or indexed) examples and labels from the dataset
add loggers to the downloads and preprocessing in the custom_datasets and data_loaders
Break:
dataloader is only loading the data, need to define a Dataset
the dataset dataloader devides randomly the train and dev sets, so we need to overcome this.

Create environment file (take from the other template)
test spacy tokenizer


define seq2seq model
    complete the EncoderDecoder
    find solution for the vocabs
get embeddings
    download embeddings on need

define trainer
define evaluator
define predictor
